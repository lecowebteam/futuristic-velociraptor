  Product rich results provide users with information about a specific product,
  such as its price, availability, and reviewer ratings. The following
  guidelines apply to product markup:
excerpt: >-
  Google Search works hard to understand the content of a page. You can help us
  by providing explicit clues about the meaning of a page to Google by including
  structured data on the page. Structured data is a standardized format for
  providing information about a page and classifying the page content; for
  example, on a recipe page, what are the ingredients, the cooking time and
  temperature, the calories, and so on.




  Google uses structured data that it finds on the web to understand the content
  of the page, as well as to gather information about the web and the world in
  general. For example, here is a JSON-LD structured data snippet that might
  appear on the contact page of the Unlimited Ball Bearings corporation,
  describing their contact information:

## Product Markup

Add markup to your product pages so Google can provide detailed product information in rich Search results â€” including Google Images. Users can see price, availability, and review ratings right on Search results.

Using markup to enable rich product results lets you attract potential buyers while they are searching for items to buy on Google or images that include products you sell. Maintain the accuracy and freshness of your product information, so your customers find the relevant, current items they're looking for.

This page explains how to mark up your product information so that Google can display rich results (previously known as rich snippets). There are two types of pages where you would typically use this markup:





```
export const botUserAgents = [
```

![Display  in Google AMP Viewer](/images/amp07-signed-exchange.png "Display  in Google AMP Viewer")

```
  'googlebot',
```

```
  'google-structured-data-testing-tool',
```

```
  'bingbot',
```

```
  'linkedinbot',
```

```
  'mediapartners-google',
```

export const botUserAgents = [

  'googlebot',

  'google-structured-data-testing-tool',

  'bingbot',

  'linkedinbot',

  'mediapartners-google',

];];
