**Top Features**

- Dual stands allow for training two students at the same time on one machine, each independently performing welds using different processes, coupons, joints and Welding Procedure Specifications (WPS).

- Retractable SMAW stick stinger, GMAW/FCAW gun and GTAW TIG torch, filler metal and adaptive foot pedal devices realistically simulate the look, feel and action of actual guns and torches.
Practice flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead 5G and 6G on mild steel, aluminum, stainless steel.

- Extremely realistic weld puddle is visually and audibly responsive to operator behavior, helping welders learn when to adjust welding technique. Welding discontinuities appear when improper technique is used.
Tracks and scores key weld parameters including work angle, travel angle, travel speed, distance and position.
